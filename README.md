# EDA-Project
“Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns, to spot anomalies, to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representa-tions.”It is a good practice to understand the data first and try to gather as many insights from it. EDA is all about making sense of data in hand, before get-ting them dirty with it.

# Problem Statement:
Hotel industry is the most investment and human resource dependent industry. With so much at stake and the dependency on the ‘Tourism Industry’, which itself is unpredictable, any decision should be on the data and not only on the intui-tion. The recent example of complete shutdown due to covid has proven the importance of analyz-ing things first. In this project I tried to find the reasons of the cancellation and how the ADR varies so that Cancellation policy and the price policy could be made taking into those things in consid-eration. 

# Project Overview:
## 1.	Data Cleaning

•	Handling Null values
•	Duplicates Consideration and the assumptions

## 2.	Data Exploration- Univariate Analysis:

•	Qualitative measures of Data i.e., Descriptive Statistics
•	Correlation between the features
•	Booking Distribution per hotel
•	Exploring the other options like yearly and monthly booking trends, meals demand, tourist’s native country, contribution of various market segments and distribution channels to the bookings etc. 

## 3.	Analyzing the factors related to cancellation:

•	Are number of days in waiting list is linked to cancellation or not?
•	If most of the cancellations were from repeated guests or the new guests?
•	The number of tourists who have previously cancelled the bookings too
•	Tourist Cancellation with respect to deposit type

## 4.	Average Daily Rate Analysis:

•	Do bookings on weekends vs on week days affect the revenue
•	How ADR is varying over the years.
•	ADR with respect to various room types
•	Contribution of various market segments to ADR in these years
•	Contribution of various distribution channels to ADR in these 2 years
